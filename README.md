This is a simple game using Pygame library of code that allows one to create  games using Python. Using  a code example of how to create a game , I  created my own game based on the code. The game is based on pacman with the theme of outerspace. In the game you control a player who must quickly navigate too the winning prize item , while avoiding the monster and its ghost aliens trying to get in the way of the player to stop this. This all happening in outer space. s.

screen from different positions. If the player object collides with any enemy object, they lose, and the game ends. There is 1 ‘prize’ object, that if the player object collides with the prize object, they win, and the game ends.
